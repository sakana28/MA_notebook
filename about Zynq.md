The Zynq All Programmable System-on-Chip (APSoC) by Xilinx brings together the adaptability of a standard processor and the customizability of an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array). This combo delivers high performance, flexibility, and the ability to scale. A standout feature of Zynq is its ability to be programmed at the logic level. It contains units for logic processing, signal processing blocks, and memory areas that can be set up to perform specific tasks. This lets developers design specialized circuits, freeing up the processor for other jobs.

The Zynq-7000 platform has an architecture that can be explained using Figure 1.1.This architecture consists of two main parts: the Processing System (PS) and the Programmable Logic (PL). PL based on the Artix®-7 and Kintex®-7 FPGA fabric. 除了Configurable Logic Block(CLB)和Switch Matrix等必要部分外，它包含了DSPs and Block RAMs，提供了更强大的运算能力和存储能力。

In addition to its customizable logic, Zynq comes with a powerful Dual-Core ARM Cortex-A9 processor as well as a set of associated processing resources like hardware floating-point units to form an Application Processing Unit (APU). with further peripheral interfaces, cache memory, memory interfaces, interconnect, and clock generation circuitry. [zedbook] 上述所有构成了Zynq的Processing System（PS）这个系统支持多种 real-time operating systems, including Linux. A fast connection links the processor and the programmable logic, making data transfer between the two quick and efficient.

Zynq also benefits from support through the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite, a complete set of tools for developing custom system-on-chip (SoC) solutions. This suite provides everything needed for both hardware and software development, from initial design to final testing. Xilinx offers thorough documentation and training resources to help developers make the most of what Zynq has to offer. In my own project, I made heavy use of these official materials as well as community resources.

Within the Zynq system, the programmable logic section is known as the PL side, and the processor section is called the PS side. When Zynq starts up, the PS is the first to boot, followed by the PL setup. The PS can run operating systems like Linux and acts like an embedded processor. On the other hand, the PL functions as a specialized FPGA unit within the overall system.

In summary, Zynq offers a strong and adaptable platform for developing embedded systems. Its combination of programmable logic and a dual-core processor allows it to handle a wide range of tasks.
