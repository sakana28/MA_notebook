The Zynq All Programmable System-on-Chip (APSoC) by Xilinx brings together the adaptability of a standard processor and the customizability of an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array). This combo delivers high performance, flexibility, and the ability to scale. A standout feature of Zynq is its ability to be programmed at the logic level. It contains units for logic processing, signal processing blocks, and memory areas that can be set up to perform specific tasks. This lets developers design specialized circuits, freeing up the processor for other jobs.

The Zynq-7000 platform has an architecture that can be explained using Figure 1.1.This architecture consists of two main parts: the Processing System (PS) and the Programmable Logic (PL). PL based on the Artix®-7 and Kintex®-7 FPGA fabric. 除了Configurable Logic Block(CLB)和Switch Matrix等必要部分外，它包含了DSPs and Block RAMs，提供了更强大的运算能力和存储能力。

In addition to its customizable logic, Zynq comes with a powerful Dual-Core ARM Cortex-A9 processor as well as a set of associated processing resources like hardware floating-point units to form an Application Processing Unit (APU). with further peripheral interfaces, cache memory, memory interfaces, interconnect, and clock generation circuitry. [zedbook] 上述所有构成了Zynq的Processing System（PS）这个系统支持多种 real-time operating systems, including Linux. A fast connection links the processor and the programmable logic, making data transfer between the two quick and efficient.

Zynq also benefits from support through the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite, a complete set of tools for developing custom system-on-chip (SoC) solutions. This suite provides everything needed for both hardware and software development, from initial design to final testing. Xilinx offers thorough documentation and training resources to help developers make the most of what Zynq has to offer. In my own project, I made heavy use of these official materials as well as community resources.

为了实现PS与PL之间的高速通信，Zynq提供了多个The AXI-Ports (Advanced eXtensible Interface) 。在工作中涉及到了General Purpose Port和High Performance Ports，将在后续章节中详细阐述。Additionally, interrupt signals enable the programmable logic to trigger events that interrupt the processor's operation. These features collectively make SoC FPGAs an incredibly flexible platform for hardware-software co-designs。




重要的是，Zynq处理系统不仅包括ARM处理器，还包括一组相关的处理资源，形成一个应用处理单元（APU）Importantly, the Zynq processing system encompasses not just the ARM processor, but a set of associated processing resources forming an Application Processing Unit (APU)


TThe Zynq All Programmable System-on-Chip (APSoC) from Xilinx combines the adaptability of a general-purpose processor with the customizability of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), resulting in a powerful platform that delivers high performance, flexibility, and scalability. One noteworthy feature of the Zynq architecture is its ability to program at the logic level, which includes logic processing units, signal processing blocks, and configurable memory areas tailored to specific tasks. This capability enables developers to create specific circuits, freeing up the processor for additional computational tasks.

The platform's structure, depicted in Figure {1.1}, consists of two primary parts: the Processing System (PS) and the Programmable Logic (PL). The FPGA fabric of the PL is based on the Artix®-7 and Kintex®-7 FPGAs and includes not only essential elements such as Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs) and the switch matrix, but also DSPs and Block RAMs that extend the computational and memory capabilities.

In addition to its customizable logic, the Zynq platform integrates a potent Dual-Core ARM Cortex-A9 processor and associated processing resources, forming an Application Processing Unit (APU). This ensemble includes hardware floating-point units, peripheral interfaces, cache memory, memory interfaces, interconnects, and clock generation circuitry. The PS of Zynq supports various real-time operating systems, including Linux, and boasts a fast connection that facilitates swift and efficient data transfer between the processor and the programmable logic.

Furthermore, Zynq benefits from robust support via the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite, a comprehensive toolset for developing custom system-on-chip (SoC) solutions. This suite encompasses all necessary resources for both hardware and software development, spanning from initial design to final testing. Xilinx provides extensive documentation and training materials to aid developers in harnessing the full potential of Zynq. In my own project, I heavily relied on these official resources as well as contributions from the community.

To enable high-speed communication between the PS and PL, Zynq offers multiple AXI-Ports (Advanced eXtensible Interface), including General Purpose Ports and High-Performance Ports, which will be elaborated upon in subsequent sections. Additionally, interrupt signals empower the programmable logic to trigger events that interrupt processor operations. Collectively, these features establish SoC FPGAs as an exceptionally versatile platform for hardware-software co-designs.
