The algorithm enables users to freely generate simulated vibration signals from rolling element bearings with different defects and under different operating conditions. Users are able to modify various features, such as bearing geometry, fault location, stage of the fault, cyclostationarity of the signal, and random contributions. In this work, operations like quadratic interpolation and generating random numbers from specified distributions are required to produce the desired signals. These operations are difficult to implement on an FPGA. Moreover, there is no need in subsequent work to dynamically configure the generated signals during system operation. Therefore, instead of generating the signals directly on the FPGA, a software-hardware codesign approach is taken. The stimulus signals are first generated in Python. The samples are stored as text files, which are then read by the Zynq PS through the SD card interface. The stored samples serve as the signal source for the signal generator implemented in programmable logic. Thus, the waveform generation and storage is separated from the real-time playback on the FPGA. Users can modify signal generation relevanted parameters in Python while the hardware interface remains unchanged. New stimuli files can be deployed by simply copying them to the SD card. The Zynq All Programmable System-on-Chip (APSoC) from Xilinx combines the adaptability of a general-purpose processor with the customizability of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), resulting in a powerful platform that delivers high performance, flexibility, and scalability. One noteworthy feature of the Zynq architecture is its ability to program at the logic level, which includes logic processing units, signal processing blocks, and configurable memory areas tailored to specific tasks. This capability enables developers to create specific circuits, freeing up the processor for additional computational tasks. The platform's structure, depicted in Figure {1.1}, consists of two primary parts: the Processing System (PS) and the Programmable Logic (PL). The FPGA fabric of the PL is based on the Artix®-7 and Kintex®-7 FPGAs and includes not only essential elements such as Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs) and the switch matrix, but also DSPs and
