The signal generator developed in this work is aimed to emulate the functionality of the KX134 accelerometer. Therefore, this section provides background information on the basic capabilities and interface of the KX134 that are relevant to reproducing its operation. 

The KX134 is a triaxial accelerometer from Kionix that is capable of measuring acceleration forces along the X, Y, and Z axes. Acceleration data is transmitted through an I2C interface. Key registers enable the configuration of the sensor range, output data rate, triggering options, and filtering parameters.
