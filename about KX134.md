The signal generator developed in this work is aimed to emulate the functionality of the KX134 accelerometer. Therefore, this section provides background information on the basic capabilities and interface of the KX134 that are relevant to reproducing its operation. 
## KX134
The KX134 is a triaxial accelerometer from Kionix that is capable of measuring acceleration forces along the X, Y, and Z axes. The KX134 enables user interaction, such as configuring its settings or reading acceleration data, via I2C or SPI protocols. By writing data into specific registers, users can configure various features, including sensor range, output data rate, triggering options, and buffer size.
