It is necessary to connect the custom I2C IP core and AXI IIC IP core via jumper wires on the development board instead of directly in the block design, as FPGAs do not have internal tristate components. However, the IOBs, a circuitry assembly located near each pin of the FPGA, contain tristate components. Thus, the signals that the custom I2C module reads or drives are actually scli, sclo, sclt, sdai, sdao and sdat. During synthesis, Vivado can infer that the I2C interface in the top-level design requires the tri-state buffer IOBUF and automatically connect the above signals to it to enable bi-directional signalling with external devices.
