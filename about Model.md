Cyclostationary signals are stochastic processes with periodic time-varying mean and autocorrelation functions. Earlier modeling works of vibration signals of rolling bearings often assumedto be stationary processes with autocorrelations independent of time, which neglected the inherently non-stationary nature of random slips of the rolling elements.(‘‘Differential Diagnosis of Gear and Bearing Faults,’’ Antoni, J., and Randall). Antoni and Randall (2003) first modeled vibrations produced by localized faults as cyclostationary processes, providing a basis for fault diagnosis.
