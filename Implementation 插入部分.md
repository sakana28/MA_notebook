The samples are stored as text files, which are then read by the Zynq PS through the SD card interface. The stored samples serve as the signal source for the signal generator implemented in programmable logic. Thus, the waveform generation and storage is separated from the real-time playback on the FPGA. Users can modify signal generation relevanted parameters in Python while the hardware interface remains unchanged. New stimuli files can be deployed by simply copying them to the SD card.
