The samples are stored as text files, which are then read by the Zynq PS through the SD card interface. The stored samples serve as the signal source for the signal generator implemented in programmable logic. Thus, the waveform generation and storage is separated from the real-time playback on the FPGA. Users can modify signal generation relevanted parameters in Python while the hardware interface remains unchanged. New stimuli files can be deployed by simply copying them to the SD card. 



During pin assignment in hardware design, the I/O pins of the Zynq PL fabric can be configured with internal pull-up elements that pull undriven pins to a logic high state. Together with tri-state buffers, this implements the open-drain output required for I$^2$C operation. However, the internal pull-up resistor and the pin parasitic capacitance, primarily from the package and PCB trace, form an unintentional resistive-capacitive (RC) delay element. This RC delay slows the signal edge transitions compared to a push-pull output with similar drive strength. That result in that I2C used for communication between low-speed devices. On the ZC706 board, the Zynq I/O pins connect to headers through a TXS0108E 8-bit bi-directional level shifter. According to the datasheet, this device supports maximum data rates of 110 Mbps for push-pull outputs versus only 1.2 Mbps for open-drain outputs. This speed limitation directly restricts the maximum SCL rate for this project.
