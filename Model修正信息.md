根据Ho and Randall [6]，model the bearing fault vibrations as a series of impulse responses of a single-degree-of-freedom(SDOF)system, where the timing between the impulses has a random component simulating the slippery effect.


循环稳态说明故障存在 the fundamental observation to keep in mind from now onward is that cyclostationarity is symptomatic to the presence of faults, owing to the occurrence of repetitive shocks when a defect impacts a rolling surface (a series of repetitive shocks may be seen as a signal periodically amplitude modulated in time)

轴承在运行时这些冲击的重复导致了一系列脉冲响应，其时间间隔取决于故障的类型和轴承的几何形状。附录A.1中的表格提供了一些典型的故障频率 Typical fault frequencies
