Zynq is an All Programmable System-on-Chip (APSoC) developed by Xilinx, seamlessly blending the software programmability of a processor with the hardware programmability of an FPGA. This integration yields a high-performance, flexible, and scalable system platform. One of Zynq's standout features is its programmable logic architecture, consisting of programmable logic units, digital signal processing blocks (DSP), and configurable memory blocks. These resources can be tailored to execute custom functions, empowering developers to create highly optimized, application-specific digital circuits for specialized tasks while freeing the processor for other duties.

In addition to its programmable logic architecture, Zynq incorporates a Dual-Core ARM Cortex-A9 processor, endowing the platform with robust processing capabilities and the ability to run a range of real-time operating systems, including Linux. A high-speed connection links the processor and the programmable logic structure, facilitating swift and efficient data exchange between the two components.

The Zynq platform is fully supported by the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite, an extensive design environment for custom SoC development. The suite offers a variety of tools for designing, integrating, and verifying both hardware and software components. Moreover, Xilinx provides comprehensive documentation, reference designs, and training materials to aid developers in familiarizing themselves with Zynq and harnessing its full potential. Throughout my project, I leveraged these official Xilinx resources and community-contributed materials extensively.

The programmable logic portion of Zynq is referred to as the PL side, while the processor system component is known as the PS side. The Zynq boot process invariably commences with the PS, followed by the configuration of the PL. The PS can be regarded as an embedded processor capable of running an operating system such as Linux, while the PL serves as an FPGA acting as a peripheral for the embedded system.

During my internship, I utilized a development board based on the Zynq-7000 chip. The FPGA section of this chip is founded on Xilinx's 28nm 7 Series FPGA, hence the "7000" appended to the product name, aligning with the 7 Series designation.

In summary, Zynq presents a potent and versatile platform for embedded system development. With its programmable logic architecture and Dual-Core processor, it can tackle a wide array of tasks, making it an ideal choice for various applications.
