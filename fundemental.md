This chapter presents an overview of cyclostationary signals and introduces a vibration signal model for rolling element bearings. The model is based on the concept of cyclostationary signals and serves as the foundation for subsequent work. Next, the Zynq SoC architecture and the ZC706 development board used in this thesis are also introduced.
