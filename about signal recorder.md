In this section, the desired functions of the Signal Recorder system are first discussed, followed by dividing the implementation of these functions into the PS- and PL-side. 

Firstly, to communicate with the KX134 accelerometer, an I2C interface is absolutely necessary. The ZC706 evaluation board implements one I2C port on both the PL- and PS-side of the Zynq SoC. However, they are connected to an existing I2C Bus in order to communicate with I2C devices (e.g. EEPROM) that are fixed on the board. Therefore, the KX134 can only connect to the PL-side of Zynq SoC through the GPIO Header. 

On the other hand, the recorded signals need to be stored for further analysis and processing, which can be conveniently done via the SD card slot on the ZC706 board. Thus, the acceleration data must be transferred to the PS-side to be written to the SD card. For this purpose, the AXI-IIC IP core is used for both the I2C interface implementation and the data transfer between PL and PS. 

Additionally, the signal recorder should allow the user to control sampling initiation at runtime. In Zynq embedded system, the scanf and printf functions in applications use the PS Uart by default. So controlling the program running on a PS from a PC is easily realized via the on-board USB-UART interface and a serial device port on the PC. 

Figure () shows the system block diagram for this signal recorder design. The configuration of KX134 is determined in the application program running in the PS and transmitted over the AXI4 bus to the AXI-IIC IP core. This IP core converts the configuration data to I2C signals and writes it to the specific registers of KX134. When the user inputs a specific command to the PS via the serial port on the PC, the PS writes a control signal to CNTL1 via the AXI-IIC to activate sampling. Once the number of samples in the Buffer reaches a threshold, the KX134 generates an interrupt on its INT1 pin. This pin is connected to the IRQ_F2P port on PS through a GPIO pin on PL, which will trigger the interrupt service routine in PS to read the acceleration data. Finally, the data is stored as text files in the SD card. 

### IP Core
Chapter 4 explains the software programming of the Zynq Embedded System in Vitis IDK. Following section focuses on the hardware modules that need to be integrated into Vivado to realize the functionality of the system, and how to configure them properly.

#### zynq ip CORE 
 
 The first step is to add the ZYNQ7 Processing System IP core in block design, which serves as an interface between the non-FPGA processing system components and the FPGA-implemented IP blocks, unlike soft processor IPs such as MicroBlaze.

- MIO pin allocation
- DDR memory and clock configuration
- Interrupts control configuration
- Interconnect logic between Vivado IP and PS
##### MIO
PS部分的引脚除了电源、地、时钟、复位和DDR专用引脚外均为Multiuse I/O(MIO)引脚. PS最多可提供 54 个 MIO 端口。The wizard allows user to choose the peripheral ports to be connected to MIO ports。MIO的灵活性给方便了板子的多样设计。如果需要更多MIO，设计者还可以开启EMIO，即为让PS端使用PL端的管脚与peripheral连接。
##### Interrupt
PS IP core enables routing of interrupts from the PL peripherals and custom logic to trigger software handlers in the PS. Both private peripheral interrupts (PPI) and shared peripheral interrupts (SPI) are supported. the Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) built into the PS manages interrupt handling for both cores. It ensures interrupts are handled sequentially by only one core based on configured priority levels. It also implements interrupt distribution schemes for multi-core coordination. PL peripherals and logic can leverage the GIC via the IRQ_F2P port on Zynq7 PS IP. In this project, SPI is used to notify the PS of buffer watermark events.



##### AXI-port

在ZYNQ芯片内部用硬件实现了AXI总线协议，包括9个物理接口，分别为4个AXI-GP接口，个AXI-HP接口和1个AXI-ACP接口。其中AXI-ACP接口专用于硬件加速应用。AXI-HP即High performance都是Slave接口。主要用于PL端的主机（如DMA控制器）访问存储器如PS的On-Chip RAM 或 DDR。而AXI-GP接口则由两个Master接口和两个Slave接口。本工作中使用了一个AXI-GP Master接口，用于由PS端发起对PL端的I2C接口IP核的读写。


##### configuration 
The PS configuration streamlines integration but requires configuring key parameters like interrupts, clocks, and AXI ports. The board definition file from the manufacturer  automatically customizes settings like MIO pin multiplexing and DDR configuration to match the base Zynq design for the target board. Notably, key settings like clocks, AXI ports and PL-PS interrupt required in this project must be manually specified. For this project, a 100 MHz clock is supplied to the PL fabric, which is generated by the PS. 

#### AXI-IIC IP Core

The AXI IIC Bus Interface module provides the transaction interface to the AXI4-Lite interface. This core does not provide explicit electrical connectivity to the IIC bus. 这代表，该IP核与外界通信的信号并不是双向的，而是单向的input,output信号和用于控制三态门的信号。用户应该在设计中确保三态门缓冲和上拉电阻的存在，以符合协议要求。
