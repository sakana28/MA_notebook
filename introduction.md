Rolling bearings, also known as rolling element bearings, are critical mechanical components used in various engineering systems and industries. They facilitate the relative motion between components while reducing friction to ensure machinery functions optimally. Nevertheless, constant internal component movement can cause wear and tear leading to failures in the long haul. Thus, ensuring effectiveness in monitoring and detecting faults is essential for sustained reliability and longevity.

Vibration analysis is one of the most important and reliable techniques for monitoring the condition of rolling bearings. Through analysis of operational vibrations, engineers can identify unusual patterns, detect potential faults, and schedule maintenance before catastrophic failures. However, the lack of comprehensive experimental data sets hinders rigorous development and validation of the technique.

This has made simulated signals extremely useful for detecting faults in rolling bearings. Simulated signals are easily generated and convenient for validating new analysis techniques. The advantage of the use of simulated signals is obvious, as they are accessible within the same software environment in which the monitoring techniques are being developed, such as Matlab. Furthermore, simulated signals do not contain unpredictable noise and interference, which typically appear in real-world vibration data, making them cleaner and more consistent for testing purposes.

To develop a real-time monitoring system, it is crucial to have a signal generator and recorder as emulation platform that can seamlessly integrate simulated signals. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely used due to their flexibility in implementing communication protocols and hardware functionalities, which enables rapid development for specific requirements.

The Xilinx Zynq system-on-chip (SoC), which combines FPGA fabric with ARM processors, offers extra advantages over traditional FPGA solutions. It not only provides the hardware flexibility of FPGAs but also integrates it with the software flexibility of ARM processors. This enables engineers to easily develop and implement complex dynamic control on their hardware design.

The goal of this work is to implement and evaluate a  Zynq-based signal generator and recorder, which is encompasses Python-based simulated signals models, embedded applications developed in C, and hardware modules  in VHDL. 

This paper is organized as follows: Chapter 2 introduces the rolling bearing vibration signal model and provides basic insight into the Zynq architecture. Chapter 3 provides a brief overview of the functionality and operation of the KX134 accelerometer. This chapter also describes in detail the hardware components of the system developed to emulate the functionality of the KX134, including both IP cores provided by Xilinx and custom IP cores. Chapter 4 outlines the software development process for the system and explains its interaction with the hardware modules.In Chapter 5, a thorough evaluation of the system is performed, taking into account factors such as power consumption, FPGA resource utilization, and overall performance. The final chapter provides the conclusion of this paper. 

where h(t) is the impulse response to a single impact as measured by the sensor, q(t) takes into account the periodic modulation due to the load distribution, possible bearing unbalance or misalignment, as well as the periodic changes in the impulse response as the fault moves towards and backwards the sensor, T is the inter-arrival time between two consecutive impacts, ‚åßi accounts for the uncertainties on the inter-arrival time (jitters) of the ith impact due to the necessary random slip of the rolling elements and n(t) gathers the background noise.

1. generate a L point vector filled with zeros, corresponding at times t = n/fs, where fs is the sample frequency in Hz and n is a index ranging from 0 to L 1, 
2. place 1 at index values obtained by dividing each inter-arrival time Ti by the chosen sample frequency fs, 
3. weight the so generated vector with the weighting function q(iT), 
4. filter the weighted vector with the FFT-based method of overlap-add by choosing as filter coefficients the impulse response function of a SDOF system in terms of acceleration.
