Rolling bearings are fundamental components in many mechanical systems. They play a critical role in ensuring smooth operation, making them indispensable in various machinery applications. However, due to the continuous movement of their internal parts, these bearings are susceptible to wear. Over time, this wear can lead to system failures, causing significant operational challenges.

To detect and address these issues early, vibration signal analysis has become a primary method for monitoring bearing health. Such a technique can highlight anomalies, predicting potential failures before they lead to larger problems. But a challenge arises: there's a limited amount of real experimental data available for researchers and engineers to work with.

In the face of this data shortage, simulated signals have gained traction. These signals can be quickly generated, making them convenient for validating new analysis techniques. The advantage of simulated signals is clear: they are always accessible because they can be produced within the same software environment where the monitoring techniques are developed, like Matlab. Additionally, simulated signals lack the unpredictable noise and interference that often appear in real-world vibration data, making them cleaner and more consistent for testing purposes.

To make the most of simulated signals, there's a need for an emulation platformâ€”a system where these signals are treated and fed just like real-world data. This would enable more accurate testing of real-time monitoring systems that rely on this data. Enter Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). FPGAs are known for their adaptability. They can be tailored to handle various tasks, making them ideal for developing specific platforms, like our emulation system.

One specific FPGA platform, the Zynq, combines the power of a traditional FPGA with an ARM processor. This fusion offers better control and flexibility, especially when dealing with complex tasks. As a result, Zynq stands out as a strong choice for building advanced monitoring solutions.

In this paper, we will delve deep into a Zynq-based emulation platform. We'll discuss the simulated signal models we've developed using Python, the embedded application written in C, and the dedicated hardware modules designed using VHDL. By presenting this platform, we aim to shed light on a promising path for enhanced bearing monitoring, bridging the theoretical with the practical.
