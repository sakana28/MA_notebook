Rolling bearings, also known as rolling element bearings, are critical mechanical components used in various engineering systems and industries. They facilitate the relative motion between components while reducing friction to ensure machinery functions optimally. Nevertheless, constant internal component movement can cause wear and tear leading to failures in the long haul. Thus, ensuring effectiveness in monitoring and detecting faults is essential for sustained reliability and longevity.

Vibration analysis is one of the most important and reliable techniques for monitoring the condition of rolling bearings. Through analysis of operational vibrations, engineers can identify unusual patterns, detect potential faults, and schedule maintenance before catastrophic failures. However, the lack of comprehensive experimental data sets hinders rigorous development and validation of the technique.

This has made simulated signals extremely useful for detecting faults in rolling bearings. Simulated signals are easily generated and convenient for validating new analysis techniques. The advantage of the use of simulated signals is obvious, as they are accessible within the same software environment in which the monitoring techniques are being developed, such as Matlab. Furthermore, simulated signals do not contain unpredictable noise and interference, which typically appear in real-world vibration data, making them cleaner and more consistent for testing purposes.

To develop a real-time monitoring system, it is crucial to have an emulation platform that can seamlessly integrate simulated signals. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely used due to their flexibility in implementing communication protocols and hardware functionalities, which enables rapid development for specific requirements.

The Xilinx Zynq system-on-chip (SoC), which combines FPGA fabric with ARM processors, offers extra advantages over traditional FPGA solutions. It not only provides the hardware flexibility of FPGAs but also integrates it with the software flexibility of ARM processors. This enables engineers to easily develop and implement complex dynamic control on their hardware design.

The goal of this work is to implement and evaluate a  Zynq-based emulation platform for fault detection for rolling bears, which is encompasses a Python-based simulated signals model, embedded applications developed in C, and hardware modules  in VHDL.
