Rolling bearings, often referred to as rolling-element bearings, represent crucial mechanical components that find widespread applications in various engineering systems and industries. Their significance lies in their ability to facilitate relative motion between components while minimizing friction, thus enabling the efficient operation of machinery. However, the continual movement of internal components within bearings can lead to wear and subsequent failures over time. To ensure the reliability and longevity of these critical components, effective monitoring and fault detection techniques are essential.

Vibration analysis has emerged as a primary and reliable method for monitoring the health of rolling bearings. By analyzing the vibrations generated during operation, engineers can detect abnormal patterns, identify potential faults, and schedule maintenance before catastrophic failures occur. However, the availability of comprehensive experimental datasets for such analysis is often limited, making it challenging to develop and validate new techniques rigorously.

As a result, simulated signals have become invaluable in the field of rolling bearing fault detection. Simulated signals offer a convenient means of validating new techniques, as they can be generated using software tools like Matlab, which are commonly used for coding and research in this domain. Moreover, simulated signals eliminate the undesirable and unpredictable components that frequently appear in experimental vibration signals, allowing researchers to focus on the fundamental aspects of their proposed methods.

To develop real-time monitoring systems for rolling bearings, it is essential to create an emulation platform that can seamlessly integrate simulated signals into the monitoring system under development. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have gained popularity in this context due to their flexibility in implementing various communication protocols and hardware functionalities, making them ideal for rapid development and validation of specific requirements.

The Zynq platform, which combines FPGA fabric with ARM processors, offers particular advantages over traditional FPGAs. It provides a convenient platform for implementing complex dynamic control strategies and integrating them with the FPGA's hardware acceleration capabilities. In this paper, we present the implementation and performance evaluation of an emulation platform based on the Zynq platform for rolling bearing fault detection. This platform includes a Python-based simulated signal model, embedded applications developed in C, and hardware modules implemented in VHDL. Through this work, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Zynq-based emulation platform in facilitating advanced rolling bearing fault detection techniques, bridging the gap between simulated signals and real-time monitoring systems.
