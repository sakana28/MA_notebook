Knowing in advance which kinds of applications are to be ran on a given system opens a unique opportunity for optimization. By knowing which operations are commonly used in a given code base, it is possible to design custom hardware that is targeted to run these operations with high performance. When designing a custom architecture for a specific application, a designer has to choose how closely the hardware should match that application. One possibility is to create a completely custom chip which directly implements the targeted application in hardware (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit), which yields very high performance at the cost of very low flexibility. An alternative is to design a customized processor which can execute a wider variety of programs, but is targeted to run a specific kind of application with high performance. The advantage of this approach is that it is easier to apply fixes and updates to the application without having to design and manufacture a new IC. Such a processor is called an Application-Specific Instruction-Set Processor (ASIP). One way to further simplify the design process is to not design a completely new architecture from scratch, but to instead licence an existing templated ASIP design and customize that. An example for this is the Cadence® Tensilica® Xtensa® LX7, which is the IP used in this thesis [3]. Common options include adding instructions, configuring the bit widths number of registers and the width of the load/store-unit. For example, a DSP application often benefits from having hardware support for multiplication or Multiply-Accumulate operations. Furthermore, instructions and Functional Units, which are not needed for an application can be excluded to save area and have higher power efficiency. Finally, a designer can create completely custom functional units, which are targeted for specific, performance-critical parts of the application. 3 2 Fundamentals The downside of using an ASIP is that it has to be specially manufactured, which incurs significantly higher costs than simply using an off-the-shelf architecture. Whether it is worth to invest in manufacturing a custom processor is generally determined by running the target application on a software simulator of the ASIP and collecting profiling information on how well the architecture performs [10].
