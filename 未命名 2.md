Zedboard is a low cost development board which uses a device from the Zynq-7000 family. It uses the device Z-7020 (part number - XC7Z020-CLG484 with speed grade -1) and has all required peripherals for implementation of image processing applications. This device contains reconfigurable fabric from the Artix-7 family which provides highest system performance per dollar per watt among the others in the 7-series of Xilinx programmable logic and shows 50% power reduction compared to the previous generations [23]. The Zedboard comes with 512 MB of onboard DDR3 memory and a SD-Card slot capable of hosting Linux file systems [46]. Figure 4.2 shows a block diagram depicting the important peripherals on the board.
